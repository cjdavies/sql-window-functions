Challenge: Aggregate window functions

I created challenges for chapters four, five, and six of this course. You will find the challenge requirements, guidelines, and the expected results in the code files for each chapter. In the same folder, you will find a file with my suggested solution, which I'm going to walk you through in the following video. I've contemplated the challenges' difficulty level for a while and it was not an easy decision. On one hand, a challenge that is too difficult will require much effort and may discourage you. On the other hand, a trivial one kind of misses the whole point of a challenge and for me, solving a tough challenge is one of the most rewarding experiences of SQL. And the more time and effort I need to invest in it, the greater the reward. This is an advanced SQL course, so I decided to lean slightly towards the more difficult side of the spectrum. Please let me know your feedback in the Q and A section. SQL is an amazing declarative language and enables multiple correct solutions using different approaches, features, and syntax. Consider my suggested solution as one option and not necessarily the best one. I choose solutions that demonstrate the concepts clearly and that are generic enough to be of value in different similar cases. If you find another solution that you like, please share it in the Q and A section for everyone to enjoy. I love seeing solutions that I learn from. If you're using a database other than Postgres, you may need to use different syntax and find alternatives for unsupported features. However, you may find even better solutions using features that Postgres doesn't support. Now to get you started, this first challenge is a warm-up and is not hard. The following ones will be more difficult, enjoy.
