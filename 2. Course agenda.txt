Course agenda

We'll begin with a brief introduction of the tools I'm going to use an the demo database that I designed specifically for this series. We will see the course materials, how they're organized and where to find them. I recommend that you watch my Query Processing course before this one. If not, don't worry. I'll spend a few minutes reviewing query processing so that the context of window functions is clear. Next, we will realize how window functions fit in this grand scheme of query processing. We will cover the general syntax of the OVER clause and how partitioning works. After establishing this baseline, we'll be ready to dive into the actual construct of window functions. We'll see how to use the various types of frames. We'll cover some convenient shortcuts, and I'm going to warn you of some of the riskier ones. Then, you'll be ready to meet window functions in person. We'll start with aggregates. These are the most familiar and intuitive, as they are frequently used as group aggregates. But this apparent familiarity is often a cause of confusion. So I'll try to clarify the distinctions. Rank and distribution functions are next. These may become your favorite type, especially, the data analyst among you. Lastly, we will learn about offset window functions. These are going to become a vital tool in your arsenal no matter what you do with SQL. To wrap things up, I'll spend a few minutes reviewing what we've learned, provide some advice on where to go next, solicit your feedback, give you some homework, and say proper goodbye.
