Challenge - Offset window functions

Like the previous challenge, the last challenge for this course involves more than just the chapter's topic. So, of course, you will need to use offset window functions, but perhaps also aggregate functions or maybe even a RANK window function. Basic knowledge of datetime function is necessary, so if you're not familiar with these, the documentation is your friend. And please do read the requirements carefully. I left an important tip for you there that is going to save you some misery. Enjoy.
