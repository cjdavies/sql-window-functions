Using the demo and exercise files

Throughout the course, I will reinforce discussion topics with code demos. You're welcome to just watch them. It will be even better if you follow along, and much better if you pause the video occasionally and experiment by modifying these queries and coming up with your own examples. I'm also going to include several mini challenges, where I'm going to ask you to pause the video for a minute and answer a question. Chapters four, five, and six include challenge videos. My detailed suggested solution walkthroughs will follow. All code files can be downloaded from the course's page. I'm going to host them on GitHub as well, and you'll find the links in the code files. I invite you to provide feedback, either on GitHub or in the course's Q&A section.
