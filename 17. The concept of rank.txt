The concept of rank

Ranks define a relationship between a set of elements. So that's for any two elements, we can state that one is ranked higher, lower, or the same as any other. In mathematics it is called a weak order or a total preorder of elements. Reducing or simplifying a set of attributes to a numeric sequence or ratio is extremely useful for evaluating complex datasets. The ANSI SQL standard defines two window functions in the Rank category, RANK and DENSE_RANK. I've decided to include two more functions for this chapter, even though they're not considered by ANSI to be true Rank functions. These are ROW_NUMBER and NTILE. The ANSI standard defines each as a category in itself. From now on when I'll use the term Rank functions, remember I refer to all four. Partitioning is optional for Rank functions. The first major difference between Rank window functions and Aggregate window functions is their use of the ORDER BY clause. For Aggregate window functions, ORDER BY's sole purpose was for framing. For Rank functions, ORDER BY determines the basis for the rank and is mandatory. Framing doesn't make sense for Rank functions, as a rank of an expression is always relative to others within its partition. We can rank products based on size, popularity, price, age, or any other set of attributes. Let's start with the somewhat simpler ROW_NUMBER and NTILE.
